## Solana Package Framework & Solana Package UI Framework & Blue Giant Labs iOS App

The SolanaPackage repository includes a workspace named MySolWallet. Inside this workspace, there are two projects: Solana Package and MySolWallet projects. The Solana Package project has two framework targets: Solana Package, which contains code that works across different platforms, and SolanaPackageUI, which is specifically for iOS and includes iOS-specific code like the user interface (UI). Additionally, there are some test targets.

In this project, I use both vertical and horizontal slicing. Vertical slicing separates the features, while horizontal slicing is used for each individual feature.

#### Core Module:
This module contains the core models required to interact with any Blockchain, starting with Solana. It includes a networking layer that communicates with any blockchain and a data persistent layer that uses file-based storage for codable models such as public keys and keychain storage for critical information such as private keys. These public models currently include Public Keys but are open for extensions, such as wallet details like balance and transaction models. The Core module provides functionalities like creating a wallet (public and private key) from a seed phrase, querying balance and transactions, and receiving/sending SOL.

Additionally, Presentation modules support localization for four different languages: English, Portuguese, Greek, and Turkish. However, these modules are designed to be easily extensible, allowing new languages to be added with ease. This enables a wider range of users to interact with the Solana Blockchain using this module in their preferred language.

#### UI Module: 
This module is an iOS SwiftUI module that provides a set of components to build user interfaces for interacting with the Solana Blockchain. These components include views for displaying wallet details such as balance and transaction history, forms for sending and receiving SOL, and more. The UI module is designed to be easily integrated into existing iOS apps. Furthermore, this module can also be moved into a macOS framework, which can be easily integrated into existing iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps.

#### Blue Giant Labs iOS Application:

The repo also includes an iOS app called ```BGL``` that demonstrates how to use the Core and UI modules to interact with the Solana Blockchain. The app showcases the functionalities of creating a wallet, sending/receiving SOL, viewing transaction history, and more.

BGL, Blue Giant Labs, creates your crypto Solana wallet with top-tier security. This app is protected by industry-standard encryption for private keys, ensuring a secure connection with Solana. 

```
1- Export/Import Seed Phrase: Safely handle the export or import of a seed phrase to ensure wallet recovery and secure access.
2- Generate Public and Private Key Pair: Derive a wallet with its corresponding public and private keys from the seed phrase.
3- Display Public Keys: List all associated public keys for the wallet.
4- Retrieve Balance: Fetch and display the balance of a specific public key.
5- View Transaction History: Display the past transactions associated with a specific public key.
6- Send and Receive SOL: Enable sending and receiving of SOL tokens for a specific public key.
7- Monitor Solana Assets: Track the assets held under the Solana blockchain.
8- View Single Asset Details: Monitor detailed information about a specific Solana asset.
9- Activate Neptune Line: Enable and utilize the Neptune Line feature for analysis on a specific Solana asset.
10- Track Portfolio Progress: Monitor the performance and growth of the portfolio associated with a specific public key.
```

The SDK is written in Swift and is intended to be used in Swift apps.

The SDK is open-source and hosted on Github, developers can use the SDK to build their own apss to connect with decentralized apps (dApps) on Solana Blockchain. Contributions are always welcome. Please find the details at the end on how to contribute.

```BGL``` is avaiable on Test Flight.

## Create Wallet BDD Specs (Under Maintenance)

### Create Wallet / Receive Sol
### Story: Customer requests to create a solana wallet

### Narrative #1
```
As a customer
I want the app to create a solana wallet
So I can connect to Solana Blockchain
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the customer has seed phrase
When the customer requests to create a solana wallet
Then the app should display the seed phrase
And create a solana wallet from that seed phrase
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the customer doesn't have a seed phrase
Then the app should display an error message
Given the customer have a seed phrase
And the seed phrase is valid
Then the app should create a valid Solana account
```

  And thereâ€™s a cached version of the balance
  And the cache is less than seven days old
  When the customer requests to see the balance
  Then the app should display the latest balance saved
Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And thereâ€™s a cached version of the feed
  And the cache is seven days old or more
  When the customer requests to see the balance
  Then the app should display an error message
Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And the cache is empty
  When the customer requests to see the balance
  Then the app should display an error message
Given the customer doesn't a valid public Solana address
  Then the app should display an error message
